// This module defines the combo or streak counter that users have in the game (it depends on the user's input (keyboard))
// Combo will be lost when the user misses map timing
// Input for this module is whether or not user accurately hits map timings (Expected Output from a Timing Module or something of that sort)
// Output value in this module will not be a sprite. This module serves only as the logic behind the function (Integer Value)
// This module is very similar to Health_Bar, except it will return counter to 0 if user misses map timing
